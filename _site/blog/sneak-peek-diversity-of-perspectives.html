<p>I’ve mentioned <a href="/blog/so-whats-up-with-the-book">a time</a> or <a href="/blog/new-year-new-momentum">two</a> on this site that I’m writing a book aimed at people just now jumping into software development, but I haven’t shared any of the book outside of some editors… until now.</p>

<p>I figure there’s a few benefits to sharing parts of a book before it’s done. For one, maybe it’ll get a person or two pumped up about reading the book once it’s completed. Two, it’ll help motivate me to finish this book if I feel like more people are waiting on it.</p>

<p>A big piece of my book is made up of interviews with experienced software people. To give a feel for the wide variety of viewpoints readers can expect to see in my book, I wrote the section below, which will be near the beginning of the book.</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts on it! And if you decide you’d like to follow along as this book progresses, either <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSHAza-dYgLOqR20o_hwcTtbd1o4d2d5-0wM8Ssadpnh7hBQ/viewform">leave your email here</a> or <a href="/feed.xml">follow the RSS feed</a>.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 15px">Diversity of Perspectives</h1>
<p>Although many of the excellent software professionals who appear here crossed paths with me in a small geographic area (North Carolina’s Research Triangle), they have wildly different backgrounds and experiences, providing a diverse set of viewpoints in their answers.</p>

<p>Many of the software experts in this book don’t have “traditional” computer science backgrounds. Some dropped out of college or graduated with a degree unrelated to programming. Many of them have worked in completely different fields, including a science museum docent, cicerone (like a sommelier, but for beer!), farmer, chef, and high school teacher, before making the move into software.</p>

<p>These people have lived all over the world – India, Vietnam, Singapore – and across the USA, from Portland on down to Miami. They’re fluent in a slew of programming languages, including JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Python, and Elixir, as well as many real-world languages, such as Hindi, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Bosnian, and German, to name a few. They’ve worked many different jobs at a wide variety of companies. Several have founded their own successful startups, while others have worked at international mega-corporations like Google and Cisco.</p>

<p>Some of them have even written tech books of their own! And a few others are core contributors to very popular code libraries (Babel and Terraform, to name two) that are used daily by tens of thousands of software developers around the world.</p>

<p>Thanks to this depth and diversity, this book is able to provide many different viewpoints and advice from these software professionals. I know I learned a ton from reading the respondents’ survey responses, and I bet you will, too; this book is chock-full of lessons about how to succeed in the software biz and to better understand just what it’s like to work in this field.</p>

<p>With such a wide, fantastic pool of software development knowledge at my beck and call, I had to come up with some dang good questions to ask in hope of drawing out all that sweet, hard-won programming wisdom. To set the scene, and also so you know the questions I sent these experts (and why), I’ll go over them here and answer each one myself. After that, we’ll move on to the meat and potatoes of this book: the illuminating responses from the esteemed programming professionals.</p>
