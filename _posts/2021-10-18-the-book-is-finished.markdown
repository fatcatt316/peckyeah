A few years ago, an [All Things Open](https://www.allthingsopen.org/) talk entitled "How to Write Your First Tech Book" gave me the **gumption** to write the kind of book that I would've wanted to have when I first got into programming.

After tons of emails, interviews, coffee, writing, coffee, reviews, edits, coffee, and working with a cover designer, **_Data Dump: Insider Advice from Software Professionals_**, the book, is done and available!
<div class="parrot-de-fiesta">
  <img src="/assets/images/party-parrot.gif" alt="Party parrot" title="There goes that crazy parrot"/>
</div>

When I first started writing the book, a veteran tech author gave me the sage advice, "Just plan on it taking 2x longer to complete than you expect!" And boy was he right.

Thanks a **_ton_** to everyone who took part in the interviews, and everyone who helped edit the book. It's finally done! If you have any questions or feedback about the book, please reach out by email or <a href="https://twitter.com/fatcatt316">on Twitter</a>.

Por favor <a href="./datadump.html">head over here to read more about the book</a>! Or, you can just <a href="https://peckyeah.gumroad.com/l/datadump/peckyeah25">buy the book here</a> and use the code **"peckyeah25"** to save 25%.
