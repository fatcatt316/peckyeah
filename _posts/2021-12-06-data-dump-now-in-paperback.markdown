As great as it was to finally get the [Data Dump book done and available as an ebook]({% link _posts/2021-10-18-the-book-is-finished.markdown %}), it didn't quite feel like The Real Thingâ„¢. Heck yeah, it was great to finally have this software development book published and available to the world, but it wasn't tangible.

I had to ask myself, WWGD (What Would [Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg#Printing_press) Do)? He'd print the dang book, that's what! I slammed my fist onto my desk, resolute in my goal of printing this book. A portrait of Abraham Lincoln looked on, aloof and judgemental.

[I mentioned awhile back that I'd started working with a book cover designer](% link _posts/2021-06-05-designing-the-book-cover.markdown). We'd ended up with a book cover that worked great for digital books, but the design needed a bit more work before it was ready to be used as a paperback cover design, partially because paperback book covers have to be sized according to how wide the book is (how many pages long it is).

During a recent family road trip to Florida, I took my wife's advice and tried out Fiverr. I ended up finding [a professional graphic designer who went by the name of Rony](https://www.fiverr.com/rony8666). After sending him the design files and talking with him a bit, I sent him the order.

He was great to work with -- super responsive, thorough, and professional. After a little bit of back-and-forth designs, we landed on the final one.

After that, it was on to KDP ([Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com)), where I navigated a few forms, uploaded my print-ready PDF courtesy of [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/datadump/), and ordered a test paperback to mi casa.

A day or so after we hosted Thanksgiving, a mysterious book-shaped package arrived. Eager hands a-tremblin', I tore open the package, and held the world's first paperback copy (rare collector's edition) of _Data Dump_. Finally, a real book.
