_A note from David Rodgers_

<p>
  Asheville City Council is considering allowing a donated Jones Park Playground to be rebuilt at their next meeting <strong>Tuesday, May 24th</strong>. We need your help letting them know we want this park rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
  More than $311,000 is available to rebuild this playground from generous private donors. No tax dollars needed to get this treasured asset rebuilt. The only thing stopping this is the City of Asheville has been reluctant to provide long-term maintenance.
</p>
<p>
  I have been asking city leaders for a commitment to provide maintenance since November 2021. We have quotes to rebuild with the same equipment as the Tempie Avery Playground in Montford and have had the funds to do this for more than six months now. City staff says budgeted maintenance of this equipment is $1,500 per year 1-10, $3,500 - $5,000 for years 11-20.
</p>
<p>
  It seems a small ask to have the City Parks and Recreation maintain what was essentially a city park. Asheville City Schools is offering to lease this land to the city in perpetuity for a <strong>dollar a year</strong> if the city will agree to provide long-term maintenance.
</p>

<p>
  The city is partnering with Carolina Day, a private school in the county, to use their soccer complex, likely providing maintenance of their facilities. I sincerely hope we can partner with our public school, actually in the city limits. There is a long history of collaboration here. The city and city schools partnered with volunteers to build this playground back in 1999. The city logo is on the Jones Park Playground sign, and the city provided maintenance the first five years.
