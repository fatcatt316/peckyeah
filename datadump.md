## Who's this Book for?
People who are considering getting into (or have recently started) software engineering, but don't know where to begin, or what to expect.

## What's in the Book?
Interviews with over 50 experienced coders, startup founders, and software managers, on subjects ranging from how to get into programming all the way to struggles theyâ€™ve faced in their software careers.

They also share things that they wish _they'd_ known back when they first started in their software careers.

All their answers are consolidated and summarized by someone (me!) with over 15 years of software engineering experience.

_Data Dump_ helps make a career in software development **more accessible, feasible, and less daunting**.
